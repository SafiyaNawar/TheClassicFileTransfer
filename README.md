# TheClassicFileTransfer
Simulates a client-server architecture for file transfer. Allows the client to upload a file to the server. The server splits the file into smaller chunks, assigns each chunk a sequence number, and transmits these chunks back to the client. The client reassembles the file in the correct order and verifies its integrity using a checksum.
